# To Do

A list of things that I would like to learn about. Not necessarily
related to configuration, but related to one of the tools (e.g. fish,
vim, tmux, etc.) that I configure in my dotfiles.

## fish

## Git

  * [x] learn if there *are* useful git configurations to put in my
    dotfiles

## tmux

## Vim

  * [ ] location list vs quickfix list
  * [ ] filetype plugin for filetype-specific commands
